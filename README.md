I have focused on Smart Contract development with Solidity for 3 years.
Developed the smart contracts and full-stack blockchain projects (FE + BE).

I wish to become the best developer in the blockchain space and now I am still trying hard and challenging myself.

In those days, my skill set in blockchain such as Ethereum, Smart contract, NFT minting, and NFT marketplace for P2E game on Ethereum compatible blockchains and Solana blockchain and useDapp, Web3.js and Ether.js for FE was so much improved.
